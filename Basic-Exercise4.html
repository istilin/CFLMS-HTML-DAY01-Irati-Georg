	<h1>The Offspring Lyrics </h1>
	<h2>"The Kids Aren't Alright"</h2>


	<div>The old neighborhood was so alive</div>
	<div>And every kid on the whole damn street</div>
	<div>Was gonna make it big and not be beat</div>

<p> </p>

	<div>Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn</div>
	<div>The kids are grown up but their lives are worn</div>
	<div>How can one little street</div>
	<div>Swallow so many lives?</div>

<p> </p>


	<div>Chances thrown</div>
	<div>Nothing's free</div>
	<div>Longing for what used to be</div>
	<div>Still it's hard</div>
	<div>Hard to see</div>
	<div>Fragile lives, shattered dreams</div>
	<div>Go!</div>

<p> </p>

	<div>Jamie had a chance, well she really did</div>
	<div>Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids</div>
	<div>Mark still lives at home 'cause he's got no job</div>
	<div>He just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot</div>

<p> </p>

	<div>Jay committed suicide</div>
	<div>Brandon OD'd and died</div>
	<div>What the hell is going on</div>
	<div>The cruelest dream, reality</div>

<p> </p>


	<div>Chances thrown</div>
	<div>Nothing's free</div>
	<div>Longing for what used to be</div>
	<div>Still it's hard</div>
	<div>Hard to see</div>
	<div>Fragile lives, shattered dreams</div>
	<div>Go!</div>

<p> </p>

	<div> Chances thrown </div>
	<div> Nothing's free </div>
	<div> Longing for what used to be </div>
	<div> Still it's hard </div>
	<div> Hard to see </div>
	<div> Fragile lives, shattered dreams </div>
